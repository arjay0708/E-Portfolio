        <h3>Who I Am?</h3>
        <p>
          I'm Arjay R. Dabalos a 4th year student of gordon college. I'm more focus on Back-end development, creating apis and making function works.
        </p>
        <p>
          I choose Back-end because it makes me happy that user can see the actual data instead of a static data. I also made a project where i work as Full stack but Back-end
          development gives me more joy when doing it.
